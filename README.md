# Pizzas_sales_Analysis
Dataset used for educational and analysis purposes

# Help me understand how to use this correctly in both Excel and MySQL

In Excel (Basic Guide)
Open your Excel file (pizza_sales_excel_file.xlsx)

Use formulas like:

Total Revenue: =SUM(total_price_column)

Total Orders: Use =SUM(1/COUNTIF(order_id_range, order_id_range)) or use PivotTable

PivotTables:

Go to Insert > PivotTable

Drag order_date to Rows

Drag order_id to Values (Count)

Use pizza_category or pizza_size to filter/group

‚úÖ In MySQL (Best Practices)
Import the Excel data (as .csv) into a table like pizza_sales.

Use structured queries like:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Total revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales;

-- Total orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) FROM pizza_sales;

-- Pizzas sold by size
SELECT pizza_size, SUM(quantity) FROM pizza_sales GROUP BY pizza_size;
Avoid redundancy:

Don‚Äôt repeat GROUP BY unnecessarily.

Use ALIAS names for readability (AS total_orders).
